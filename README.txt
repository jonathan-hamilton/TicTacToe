Project Title:
Tic Tac Toe

Motivation:
To complete ZenDesk assignment "Build a playable implementation of Tic Tac Toe".

Tech/Framework used:
Java 8, JavaFX, SceneBuilder

Installation:
This application is packaged as a .jar file which can be executed if you have a JRE installed.

Features:
-This program features a playable game of Tic Tac Toe where players can alternate turns.
-A red label will indicate the winner of the game.
-To start a game a button is provided on the title page labeled "Press to Play".
-A reset button is provided to restart the game. The game can be stopped and reset at any time.

Decisions:
-I chose to create this application using SceneBuilder because of the ease of use and integration with Java code.
-I chose not to create a Model package/class as there was no data to persist.
